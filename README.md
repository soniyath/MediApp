Project Name: MediApp.
Authors: Yatharth Soni, Steve Markham and Ilya.
Date Created: July-August 2019.
Description: A Web Application with user friendly-UI fulfilling the purpose of registering, managing and ultimately storing the patient data into the hospital database for future usage by providing ease of access to the Hospital Team.

Project Overview: -
The purpose of this application is to provide an intuitive and organized solution for medical staff to access important patient information. Through the use of the application’s dashboard, medical staff will be able to access relevant data incredibly quickly. 
Functionality will be changed according to the kind of staff that has logged in. Nurses will be able to create new patients and update patient information such as address or allergies, while Doctors are able to access sensitive health data like blood pressure and other vitals. These differences in functionality will be reflected in the application’s user interface. Patient data will be read only from the dashboard as privacy and safety is of top priority. 
This application will be developed using the latest version of Visual Studio (16.1.6) as well as MySQL Server (8.0.16). The project will be written using the C# programming language and will implement various technologies such as Windows Forms, the .NET framework, web services, and a MySQL database for storing patient and staff information.

Directions to run: -
There are total two different applications running; where one is providing the WCF Service support to Main Web Application. The .SQL Query file is also included into the project files. Here, when we create the database the query is to be run to establish all the required tables as well as realtion with the help of Microsoft SQL Server. Moreover, the service refernece is required to be changed and update to make it compactible with the user's system and then the project runs completely fine.
Here are the steps to follow: -
1. Run the SQL file to create a Database (i.e. - to create Tables and relationship).
2. Launch the Database using Microsoft SQL Server.
3. Delete the exsiting Service Reference.
4. Create a new Service Reference from Main Application to the WCF Service Application.
5. If display all the patients gets launched successfully --> You're Good To GO! :)

All the required validations are provided with the application. However, any modification ideas or change ideas would be really appreciated! :)
